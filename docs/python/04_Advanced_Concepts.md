## 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that enables modularity, code reusability, and encapsulation. It is widely used in Machine Learning for building models, creating reusable components, and managing data pipelines.

### 🔹 Key OOP Concepts

- Class & Object – A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of a class.
- Encapsulation – Restrict direct access to variables and protect data integrity.
- Inheritance – Reuse attributes and methods from a parent class.
- Polymorphism – Different classes can implement the same method.

### 🔹 Example: OOP in Machine Learning

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def train(self):
        print(f"{self.name} model is training...")

class NeuralNetwork(Model):
    def train(self):
        print(f"Training deep learning model: {self.name}")

# Usage
model1 = Model("Linear Regression")
model2 = NeuralNetwork("CNN")

model1.train()  # Output: Linear Regression model is training...
model2.train()  # Output: Training deep learning model: CNN
```

✅ Use Case: OOP allows structured design in ML model pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment frameworks.

## 🎭 Decorators & Generators

Python decorators and generators help optimize code efficiency, making them essential in data pipelines and AI model training.

### 🔹 Decorators (Function Wrappers)

Decorators modify the behavior of functions without changing their code.

Example: Timing an ML Function

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def train_model():
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating model training time
    print("Model training complete!")

train_model()
```

✅ Use Case: Logging, debugging, measuring execution time, monitoring ML pipelines.

---

### 🔹 Generators (Memory-Efficient Iteration)

Generators are functions that return iterators lazily, saving memory when handling large datasets.

Example: Processing Large Data Efficiently

```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line  # Yields one line at a time

# Usage
for line in read_large_file("data.csv"):
    process(line)  # Process each line lazily
```

✅ Use Case: Streaming large datasets, real-time data processing in AI applications.

---

## 🔗 Iterators & Comprehensions

Efficient data handling is critical in Machine Learning when working with large datasets and feature engineering.

### 🔹 Iterators

An iterator is an object that allows traversal of elements one at a time.

Example: Custom Data Iterator

```python
class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        result = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return result

# Usage
data = DataLoader(["image1", "image2", "image3"])
for d in data:
    print(d)
```

✅ Use Case: Data loaders, streaming large datasets for ML models.

---

### 🔹 List, Dict, and Set Comprehensions

Comprehensions make data transformation concise and are widely used in feature engineering and preprocessing.

```python
# Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using list comprehension
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30]
fahrenheit = [((temp * 9/5) + 32) for temp in celsius]
print(fahrenheit)  # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0]
```

✅ Use Case: Feature scaling, data transformation, filtering large datasets.

---

## 🔄 Multithreading & Multiprocessing

Parallel execution is essential for speeding up computations in AI and ML.

### 🔹 Multithreading (Efficient for I/O-bound tasks)

Example: Fetching multiple datasets in parallel

```python
import threading

def fetch_data(source):
    print(f"Fetching from {source}")

sources = ["dataset1.csv", "dataset2.csv", "dataset3.csv"]
threads = [threading.Thread(target=fetch_data, args=(src,)) for src in sources]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

✅ Use Case: Downloading datasets, web scraping, handling I/O-heavy tasks.

---

### 🔹 Multiprocessing (Efficient for CPU-bound tasks)

Multiprocessing utilizes multiple CPU cores, making it ideal for heavy computations.

Example: Parallel Model Training

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def train_model(model_id):
    return f"Training model {model_id}"

models = [1, 2, 3, 4]
with Pool(4) as p:
    results = p.map(train_model, models)
print(results)
```

✅ Use Case: Parallel model training, large dataset processing, hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 🧵 Async & Await

Asynchronous programming is critical for handling large-scale web-based AI applications, real-time data processing, and API calls.

### 🔹 Async for Efficient I/O Operations

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulating delay
    print("Data fetched!")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(fetch_data(), fetch_data(), fetch_data())

asyncio.run(main())
```

✅ Use Case: Handling multiple API requests, web scraping for AI datasets, real-time ML monitoring.
