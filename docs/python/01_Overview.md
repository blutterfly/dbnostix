# 01 ðŸ“˜ Overview

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by   Guido van Rossum   and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular languages due to its ease of use, vast ecosystem, and broad applicability.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including   procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming  , making it a versatile choice for a variety of applications, such as   web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing  .

## Features of Python  

### 1. Simple & Readable Syntax  

- Pythonâ€™s syntax is designed to be   easy to read and write  , reducing the learning curve for beginners.
- Code readability is emphasized with   indentation-based structuring   (instead of braces `{}` like in C/C++ or Java).

### 2. Interpreted Language  

- Python is an   interpreted language  , meaning code is executed   line by line   without requiring compilation.
- This makes debugging easier but may affect execution speed compared to compiled languages.

### 3. Dynamically Typed  

- You   donâ€™t need to declare data types   explicitly; Python automatically detects them at runtime.

```python
x = 10  # Integer
y = "Hello"  # String
z = 3.14  # Float
```

### 4. Object-Oriented & Functional Programming  

- Supports   object-oriented programming (OOP)  , allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Also supports   functional programming  , allowing the use of   map, filter, lambda functions, and higher-order functions  .

### 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility  

- Python is   portable   and can run on   Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded systems   without modification.

### 6. Large Standard Library  

- Python comes with a   rich standard library   that provides modules for file handling, networking, regular expressions, data structures, and more.

```python
import math  # Using the built-in math module
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

### 7. Extensive Third-Party Libraries  

- Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries, such as:
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib   (for Data Science)
  - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn   (for Machine Learning & AI)
  - Flask, Django, FastAPI   (for Web Development)
  - Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy   (for Web Scraping)
  - PyQt, Tkinter   (for GUI Development)

### 8. Automatic Memory Management  

- Python handles memory allocation and deallocation   automatically   using   Garbage Collection (GC)  .

### 9. Multi-Purpose Language  

- Used for:
  - Web Development  
  - Data Science & Analytics  
  - Machine Learning & AI  
  - Automation & Scripting  
  - Cybersecurity  
  - Game Development  
  - Embedded Systems (MicroPython, Raspberry Pi)
