Last Updated : 23 Oct, 2024
Pandas library offers a wide range of functions, making it an indispensable tool for
data manipulation that caters to almost every task. One convenient feature, often
employed for gaining quick insights into a dataset, is the pandas describe function.
This function gives users a descriptive statistical summary of all the features, helping
them understand the data’s overall characteristics. However, for a more
comprehensive analysis, the pandas profiling Package is an additional valuable tool in
the Pandas ecosystem.
Pandas profiling is the solution to this problem. It offers report generation for the
dataset with lots of features and customizations for the report generated. In this
article, we will explore this library, look at all the features provided, and some
advanced use cases and integrations that can be useful to create stunning reports out
of the data frames!

Before I discuss the Python pandas profiling, have a look at the pandas describe
function output for the dataframe:
Copy Code
df.describe(include='all')
(Notice that I have used the include parameter of the describe function set to “all”
which forces pandas to include all the data types of the dataset to be included in the
summary. The string type values are accompanied by options such as unique, top, and
frequency)
Let’s import the Python pandas profiling library:

To start profiling a dataframe, you have two ways:
1. You can call the ‘.profile_report()’ function on pandas dataframe. This function is
Personalized GenAI Learning Path 2025✨  Crafted Just for YOU!  
not part of the pandas API but as soon as you import the profiling library, it adds
this function to dataframe objects.
You can pass the dataframe object to the profiling function and then call the
function object created to start the generation of the profile.
You will get the same output report in either of the methods. I am using the second
method to generate the report for the imported agriculture dataset.
Copy Code
profile = ProfileReport(df)

Personalized GenAI Learning Path 2025✨  Crafted Just for YOU!  
light on data quality by revealing insights into Missing cells and their corresponding
percentage, offering a quick assessment of the dataset’s completeness. The Duplicate
rows section provides information on the presence of identical rows, including the
percentage of duplicate rows. As a holistic touch, the overview concludes with the total
memory size, encapsulating the overall footprint of the dataset. Integrating pandas
profiling seamlessly facilitates a profound understanding of these essential aspects,
enhancing the efficiency of exploratory data analysis.
The warnings tab contains any warnings related to cardinality, correlation with other
variables, missing values, zeroes, skewness of the variables, and many others.

Advanced Usage
The report generated by Pandas profiling Python is a complete analysis without any
input from the user except the dataframe object. All the report elements are chosen
automatically, and default values are preferred.
There might be some elements in the report that you don’t want to include, or you
need to add your metadata for the final report. There comes the advanced usage of
this library. You can control every aspect of your report by changing the default
configurations.
Let’s see some of how you can customize your reports.

You can add information such as “title”, “description”, “creator”, “author”, “URL”,
Personalized GenAI Learning Path 2025✨  Crafted Just for YOU!  
“copyright_year”, and  “copyright_holder”. This information will appear in the dataset
overview section. A new tab called “dataset” will be created for this metadata. To add
this data to the report, use the dataset parameter in the ProfileReport function and
pass this data as a dictionary:
Copy Code
profile = ProfileReport(df,
                        title="Agriculture Data",
        dataset={
        "description": "This profiling report was generated for Analytics Vidhya Blog",

        "copyright_year": "2021",
        "url": "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/",
    },)
profile
You can also add information about the variables used in the dataset using the
variables parameter. This takes in the dictionary with descriptions as the key and
value as another dictionary with a key-value pair, where the key is the variable name
and the value is the description of the variable.

After making your reports stunning by configuring every aspect of it, you might want to
publish it anyhow. You can export it to HTML format and upload it to the web. But there
are some other methods to make your report stand out.
Widget  in Jupyter notebook
While running the panda profiling in your Jupyter notebooks, you will get the HTML
rendered in the code cell only. This disturbs the experience of the user. You can make
it act like a widget that is easily accessible and offers a compact view. To do this,
simply call “.to_widgets()” on your profile object:

Exploratory Data Analysis Using Pandas
Personalized GenAI Learning Path 2025✨  Crafted Just for YOU!  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is like exploring a new place. You start by looking
around to understand what’s there. Similarly, in EDA, you look at a dataset to see
what’s in it and what it can tell you. It’s essentially the initial data exploration stage in
data science, where you delve into the dataset statistics and examine its intricacies.
Here’s what you do during EDA:
Look at the Numbers: You start by checking basic things like averages, ranges,
and the spread of the numbers.
Make Pictures: Instead of just staring at numbers, you make charts and graphs to
show the data visually. It’s like drawing a map of your exploration.
Clean Up: Sometimes, data can be messy with missing pieces or weird values.
So, you clean it up by filling in missing parts or removing the weird stuff.
Create New Ideas: You might develop new ideas or ways to look at the data, like
combining different parts or changing how you measure things.
Find Connections: You try to see if different parts of the data are related. For
example, if one thing goes up, does another also go up?
Make Things Simple: If the data is too complicated, you might simplify it to see
the big picture more clearly.
Look at Time: If your data changes over time, you’ll examine how it changes and
whether there are any repeating patterns.
