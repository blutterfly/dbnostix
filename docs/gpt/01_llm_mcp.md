| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | An LLM is a neural-network language model trained—largely with self-supervision—on trillions of tokens so it can predict the next token in a sequence. The dominant family today are **generative-pre-trained transformers (GPT-type)** models. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])                                                               |
| **How it works**             | ① **Transformer layers** use self-attention to weigh every token against every other token, letting the model capture long-range dependencies. ② During **pre-training** it learns statistical patterns of language; during **in-context learning** it follows instructions or solves tasks given in the prompt. ([techradar.com][2]) |
| **Scale & “Chinchilla” law** | Empirical scaling laws show that performance improves roughly as a power law with respect to parameter count, training tokens, and compute—hence today’s multi-hundred-billion-parameter systems. ([en.wikipedia.org][1])                                                                                                             |
| **Typical capabilities**     | Text generation, summarization, classification, information extraction, code completion, multi-modal reasoning (when fine-tuned with images/audio), and tool invocation (“function calling”).                                                                                                                                         |
| **Strengths**                | Few-shot adaptability, broad world knowledge, multilingual ability, rapid deployment via APIs rather than bespoke ML pipelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Limitations**              | • “Hallucination” (confident but false statements) • Training-data bias • High inference cost and latency • Context-window limits • Need for guard-rails and alignment techniques such as RLHF or constitutional AI. ([en.wikipedia.org][1], [arxiv.org][3])                                                                          |

### 2. What is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**

| Aspect                 | Key points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**            | MCP is an **open, JSON-RPC 2.0–based application-layer protocol** that standardises how LLMs (or “agent” clients) request structured context and execute tool calls against external systems—databases, SaaS APIs, local files, code repos, etc. Think of it as *“USB-C for AI apps.”* ([en.wikipedia.org][4], [arstechnica.com][5])                                                                   |
| **Origins & Timeline** | Introduced by Anthropic in **Nov 25 2024** and open-sourced the same day; since **March–April 2025** OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft have officially announced support, making it the de-facto industry standard for agentic integrations. ([theverge.com][6], [techcrunch.com][7], [techcrunch.com][8])                                                                                                 |
| **Core components**    | • **MCP Client** (usually the LLM runtime or an orchestrator library) sends JSON-RPC requests such as `list_tools`, `call_tool`, or `get_context`.<br>• **MCP Server** wraps the data/tool source and returns context chunks, tool manifests, or results.<br>• **Schema**: all messages follow a versioned JSON schema with explicit auth scopes and token budgeting metadata. ([en.wikipedia.org][4]) |
| **Typical workflow**   | 1️⃣ LLM receives a user prompt (“Summarise this policy PDF”). 2️⃣ It calls `list_tools`; the server advertises a “file-reader” tool. 3️⃣ LLM issues `call_tool` with the file path, gets the text back, and produces the answer—all inside one conversational turn.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Benefits**           | *Uniformity* (one integration covers many models), *security* (fine-grained permissions instead of full file-system access), *streamlined agent chaining* (the same protocol passes intermediate results between multiple specialised tools), and *ecosystem momentum* (SDKs in Python, TypeScript, Rust).                                                                                             |
| **Challenges**         | • Still evolving spec (v0.6 as of June 2025) • Governance and version-compatibility • Need for robust auth/secret management • Potential vendor-specific extensions if not carefully standardised.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 3. How LLM + MCP fit together

1. **LLM alone** is great at reasoning over the text you give it, but it’s *stateless* and *blind* to private data or live systems.
2. **MCP bridges that gap**—the model can now pull “context blocks” or trigger functions in a consistent, auditable way.
3. This unlocks agentic patterns such as:

   * Customer-support bots that pull order data from an ERP via an MCP server.
   * Programming copilots that read current project files, run unit tests, and commit code.
   * Knowledge workers letting the assistant query DuckDB, generate a chart, then draft a summary email—all mediated through one protocol stack.

### 4. Why it matters to practitioners

*For developers* → write one MCP wrapper around your data/tool and instantly make it accessible to multiple LLM vendors; avoid bespoke plug-ins.
*For companies* → enforce consistent governance: every tool call is logged, permissioned, and revocable.
*For researchers* → simplifies benchmarking of tool-augmented reasoning by abstracting away bespoke glue code.

In short, **LLMs supply the reasoning engine; MCP supplies the safe connector.** Together they enable the next wave of AI systems that don’t just *talk* about helping—you can let them *act* on your real data with confidence.
